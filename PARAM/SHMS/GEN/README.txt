1)here, ptracking.param is the copy from Peter's directory
/u/group/c-sidis/bosted/hallc_replay/PARAM19/SHMS/GEN/ptracking.param

2)He mentioned as SPRING19, not sure if there are any issues to use thios for fall.

3)my_mkjones_ptracking.param is my version, which mkjones updated for me. But the question is as we are using purning, chi-square may not be requires as did by peter.

4)Dipole exit was included by peter but not in my version.
